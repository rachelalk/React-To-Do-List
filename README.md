<h1>To do list app </h1>

<h2> The Task: </h2>

This week's hackathon task was to use React to create a to do list app.

<h2>What I learnt:</h2>


<li>We got off to a flying start, we used Create React App to initialise our project and quickly sorted our files out so that they were organised and easy to navigate, something that I have realised is very important, especially if somebody else might want to look at your code later on. We organised our app into an App folder with a Components folder inside which contained seperate files for each component created.
<li>We were pleased with how everything was going, we had an input field and button to submit your new to do list item.
<li>We were able to use the handleChange() function to track the input in the box but ran into issues capturing the data and assigning it to the state variable.
<li>We spent a lot of time brainstorming and googling but were well and truly stuck so didn't get much further on hackathon day.
<li>We had asked for help but so many people were needing assistance, it never came. We didn't give up though, we ended the day with an array that captured the input but nothing to show on screen.
<li>I came back to this task the next day, what I realised from seeing other people's presentations is that I had totally misunderstood states and so had my partner. I thought that you could only have one state per project which was really hindering us, it turns out that you can have multiple states and with this new found knowledge I was able to complete the task alone the following day.
<li> I added the functionality to input new tasks which would display on the screen. Amended the array input to include a unique ID for each task and added a delete button to each task. - In the end I used 4 separate states to complete the task.
<li>I even added a little bit of CSS.
                                
<li>I'm really pleased with how the to do list turned out and feel much more confident with react after completing this and the weekend task of creating a blog page with a box to add a name and comment.
